My Netflix project <br>

This project is a simple Netflix-style movie layout built using React. It renders a static grid of movie tiles with information like title, age restriction, tags (genres), and descriptions. The goal was to practice working with component-based structure, data mapping, and UI layout using basic React and CSS.
